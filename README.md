The great wrestler El Conejo loves to fight... A LOT. He loves that so much that
it is what makes his heart beat. By killing his enemies, his heartbeats faster,
by being hit by them, it decreases. Attacking in rhythm with the heartbeat
increases the score multiplier! Navigate to different rings to find the exit and
access to the next level.
